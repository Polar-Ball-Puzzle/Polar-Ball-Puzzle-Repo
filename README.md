Overview
In Polar Ball, your primary objective is to navigate a ball through increasingly challenging levels by tactically switching its polarity. Each level is designed with obstacles and environmental elements that interact with the ball differently based on its current polarity. The game is optimized for mobile devices with intuitive UI button controls, providing a fun and engaging puzzle experience on the go.

Gameplay Mechanics
Polarity Switching:
The core feature of the game. The ball can be in one of three states: positive, negative or neutral. Each state determines how the ball interacts with specific Polarized platforms.

Obstacles & Platforms:
Levels are filled with barriers, moving platforms, Spikes and other elements. Avoid hitting the spikes and switch polarity just in time to get onto the moving platforms

Level Goals:
Each level features a goal to move the ball to before advancing to the next level. Directional arrows are provided to guide the player to the goal location.

How to Play
Start the Level:
When a level begins, your ball starts in a default polarity (Neutral).

Observe & Plan:

Study the Environment and Plan your moves: Look for the closest polar platform and switch the ball's polarity to either attract or repel from it (depending on the direction you want to move). Remember,"Like Poles attract and Unlike Poles Repel"

Switching Polarity:

Mobile Controls: Simply tap the Button representing the Polarity you want to switch to on the  screen to toggle the ball’s polarity. A visual indicator on the ball (+),(-),(no symbol)  will show its current state. If the game is built for Web or PC, a simple mouse click on the buttons will still work.
